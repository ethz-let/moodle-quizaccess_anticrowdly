# moodle-quizaccess_antiai
Anti-AI (Crowdly &amp; Co.) accessrule in moodle quiz

This is an early version that is still in need for tuning - use at your own risk. Tested on FF & Chrome.

@todo:
1. Allow modifications to add uniquieIDs (finger prints) of other funghi popping AI extentions.
2. More robust logic to find extensions.
3. Bring the accesserule to a heading category and allow more configurations.
4. fine-tune languague.
5. code cleanup.
